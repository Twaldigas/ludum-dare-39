# Keep Shoveling

Keep Shoveling is the first video game I made together with a friend, Huiripu. We used the Ludum Dare 39 Game Jam and the theme Running Out of Power as an opportunity to develop our very first video game together. It was fun and we were able to learn alot.

Your character is a locomotive driver in the wild west. Beside keeping the locomitve running, he has to defend the train against bandits.

The game was developed with the Godot Engine. Sounds and text font was downloaded by different sources. Textures was all made by ourselfs.
